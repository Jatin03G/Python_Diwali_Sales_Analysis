# Python_Diwali_Sales_Analysis
Python project for beginners- Analyze Diwali sales data to improve customer experience and sales
This project involved data cleaning and manipulation, exploratory data analysis (EDA) using pandas, matplotlib, and seaborn libraries.
Through this project, I was able to identify potential customers across different states, occupation, gender, and age groups, which led to an improvement in customer experience. Additionally, I identified the most selling product categories and products, which helped to plan inventory and meet the demands, ultimately leading to an increase in sales.
